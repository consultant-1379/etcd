      - usage: "Distributed Coordinator ED supports TLS and mutual TLS encryption. Distributed Coordinator ED is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being: Simple, Secure, Fast & Reliable. TLS enables the client and server to authenticate each other and to negotiate security keys before any data is transmitted. Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication ensures that traffic is both secure and trusted in both directions between a client and server."
